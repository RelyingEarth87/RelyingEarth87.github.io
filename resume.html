<div id="Projects">
    <h2 class="sectionHead">Projects</h2>

    <h3 class="title"><strong>Pokemon Go Form Filler</strong></h3>
    <p class="description">I made an automated Python script that asked the user a few questions in order to streamline data collection. 
        The form used the answers from a few questions to extrapolate data and fill out and submit a Google Form that attempted to discover 
        the frequency of Individual Values of Pokemon spawns in Pokemon Go.</p>
    <p class ="lesson">From this project, I learned more in depth about how to use the Selenium Library with Python as well as how to identify 
        and parse segments of HTML code and elements. I also learned how to interact with web pages through code.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><strong>Pokemon Go Data Scrubber</strong></h3>
    <p class="description">I programmed a script to scrape a website of Pokemon Go tournament data to count the frequency of times specific Pokemon 
        were used in Player versus Player tournaments in order to quantify data and learn the meta of each tournament.</p>
    <p class ="lesson">Building on my previous project, in this project, I also was able to use Selenium but learned to pair it with libraries like 
        Beautiful Soup and HTML Requests in order to pull data from a website. I also interacted with the Google Sheets API for data storage, 
        and I learned how to better optimize the runtime and bandwidth of programs in order to limit the load on the site servers and my own processor.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><strong>Discord Bot</strong></h3>
    <p class="description">I made a Python based bot used in a private Discord server that checked certain channels for activity, added reactions, 
        responded to commands, and tried to detect profanity.</p>
    <p class ="lesson">Through this bot, I learned how to use the Discord API, write and understand bots and server hosting better, 
        and learned how to integrate community-made libraries into my own work.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><strong>Truth or Drink Game</strong></h3>
    <p class="description">After watching a YouTube series, I decided to make a version of the game that is playable in Python and then package it to work as a .exe file. 
        The game had logic to have a stating screen, allow players to look at the rules of the game, and it stored questions to ask the players. 
        In addition, it kept score for the game and allowed players to stop the game whenever they wanted.</p>
    <p class ="lesson">This was my first time working with Python GUIs to try and make something presentable to the user on the front end. I learned how to program with 
        Tkinter inside of its object format and elements of UX design.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><strong>Portfolio Website</strong></h3>
    <p class="description">I have and am currently in the process of creating a website through GitHub, from scratch in HTML/CSS/JS, as a portfolio and repository 
        for my programming work, as well as a show of my abilities in general.</p>
    <p class ="lesson">In addition to learning more about HTML/CSS/JS while programming the website, this journey helped me learn a lot more about how to use GitHub 
        in and of itself, as well as more general items of web design and UI/UX in order to make the website more usable, functional, and better-looking.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><strong>Twitch Overlay</strong></h3>
    <p class="description">I coded and created an animated web page to function as a browser source for use in Twitch streams where viewers can interact with the 
        stream to make stuff happen.</p>
    <p class ="lesson">From this project, I learned more about animations and time scales inside of HTML documents. Also, I learned more about the jQuery library 
        and how to identify and pick out elements in HTML.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><strong>Timezone Discord Converter</strong></h3>
    <p class="description">I made a page to take text input from a user and convert any reference to time into a Discord usable Unix time code stamp so discord messages 
        will show in the viewer’s local time.</p>
    <p class ="lesson">This project was a journey in learning how to do natural language processing in JavaScript, a language that isn’t quite as built for it as Python. 
        I also learned more advanced JavaScript rules and methods, as well as how to use RegEx in order to strip back text input and save it to recombine later on. 
        Finally, I learned how to properly tag and comment on my code so it can be interpreted by myself and others later on.</p>
