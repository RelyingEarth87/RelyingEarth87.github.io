    <h1>My Coding Projects</h1>
    <p>These are projects that I have worked on in code and I will help walk you through them.</p>

        <li><a href="https://relyingearth87.github.io/fbr/fbr.html">Free Bird Rats</a></li>
        <p>This is a project that I made as a channel point redeem for my Twitch Streams. I based this on an idea from another streamer and from a classic meme. However, I made it my own by cutting out and reformatting the original video into a gif that only had the two rats in it and not all the other content, and then I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to animate it all together to make a very dynamic overlay to port into a browser source for my OBS.</p>
